## Overview
The Titanic Survival Simulation is a project that utilizes machine learning to predict the survival of passengers based on various factors. This project is built using a combination of Streamlit for the frontend, Scikit-learn for machine learning, and NumPy for numerical computations.

## Key Features
* üöÄ **Survival Prediction**: Predict the survival of passengers based on factors like age, sex, and class.
* üìä **Data Analysis**: Analyze the Titanic dataset to understand the factors that contribute to survival.
* üìà **Model Training**: Train a machine learning model to make predictions on the survival of passengers.

## Technology Stack
* Frontend: Streamlit
* Machine Learning: Scikit-learn
* Libraries: NumPy, Joblib
