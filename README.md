## Overview
This project is a *Titanic Survival Simulation* that utilizes machine learning to predict the survival of passengers based on various factors. The project is built using a combination of *Streamlit*, *Scikit-Learn*, *NumPy*, and *Joblib*.

## Key Features
* üöÄ **Prediction Model**: A trained machine learning model to predict survival chances
* üìä **Data Preprocessing**: Standardization of data using *StandardScaler*
* üìà **Visualization**: Interactive visualization using *Streamlit*

## Technology Stack
* Backend: Streamlit
* ML: Scikit-Learn
* Libs: NumPy, Joblib
